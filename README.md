 1. Import the necessary libraries: requests, ttk and ttkbootstrap
 2. Define the API endpoint to fetch quotes and create a function to get the quotes from the API
 3. Create the GUI application using Tkinter
 4. Create a frame in the GUI and add a label to display the quote and another label to display the author
 5. Add a button to fetch new quotes
 6. Define a function to update the quote and author labels
 7. Show the GUI using root.mainloop()

## Features
