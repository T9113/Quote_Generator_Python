## ✨ Key Enterprise Capabilities

- ⚡ **High Availability & Fault Tolerance:** Multi-zone redundancy with automated recovery and graceful degradation.
- 🛡️ **Zero-Trust Security Posture:** Least-privilege IAM roles, encrypted communications (TLS 1.3/mTLS), and strict network isolation.
- 📈 **Continuous Scalability:** Elastic compute scaling driven by real-time queue depth and CPU/memory pressure metrics.
- 🔍 **Full-Stack Observability:** Structured telemetry exportable to Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch, and OpenTelemetry.
- 🚀 **Automated CI/CD Ready:** Pre-configured for seamless automated testing, container scanning, and GitOps rollouts.

## 🛡️ Security, Compliance & Governance

1. **Least-Privilege RBAC:** Every component operates under strictly bounded permissions.
2. **Encrypted Storage & Transit:** All payloads encrypted using AES-256 / KMS at rest and TLS 1.3 in flight.
3. **Continuous CVE Auditing:** Verified against Aqua Trivy, Semgrep, and Gitleaks security scanners.
4. **No Secrets in Source:** Zero credentials or private keys committed; all secrets injected via external key vaults.
